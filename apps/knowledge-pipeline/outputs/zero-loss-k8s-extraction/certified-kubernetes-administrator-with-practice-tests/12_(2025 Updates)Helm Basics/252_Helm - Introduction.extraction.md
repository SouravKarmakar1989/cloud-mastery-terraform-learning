For example, even a relatively simple WordPress site might need the following, a deployment to deploy the pods that you wanna run, such as MySQL database servers or web servers, a persistent volume to store the database, a persistent volume claim, a service to expose the web server running in a pod to the internet, a secret to store credentials like admin passwords and other things, and maybe even more if you want extra stuff like periodic backups, jobs and so on.
